The group decided to all pile into a BMW to spend some time at the beirgarten.
They were all eating Bratwursts that they had gotten from the Ratskeller.
After that the group started driving and ended up on the hauptstrasse.
While driving along, they were passed up by a Porsche blaring RammsteinMusik.
The loud music reminded them that the group supervisor had requested a ride from the Flughafen after flying in on a plane due from Berlin
Then, they decided to drive there while having some klimaanlage in the car due to the weather.
