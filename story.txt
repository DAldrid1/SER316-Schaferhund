The group decided to all pile into a BMW to spend some time at the beirgarten.
They were all eating Bratwursts that they had gotten from the Ratskeller.
After that the group started driving and ended up on the hauptstrasse.
While driving along, they were passed up by a Porsche blaring RammsteinMusik.
